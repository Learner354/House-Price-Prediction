# House Price Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more.

## Project Overview
The notebook walks through:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model building using linear regression
- Model evaluation and interpretation

##  Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains housing information and is typically sourced from:
- [Kaggle: House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

> *Note: Replace the link above if you used a different dataset.*

##  Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Getting Started

To run the notebook:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Learner354/House-Price-Prediction.git
   cd House-Price-Prediction
   
## Future Work
-try different regression models (Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost)
-Add hyperparameter tuning
-Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
